# sbt-header-seed

This project is a simple sbt project on top of [scala-seed](https://github.com/scala/scala-seed.g8)
to show how you can use sbt-header plugin and automate plugins.

When you run `compile`, `test:compile` and `it:compile` tasks, headers are generated automatically for files
in each corresponding directory.
